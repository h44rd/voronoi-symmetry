Voronoi - Symmetry
===========

The website is hosted [here](http://voronoi-symmetry.surge.sh/).

### Local Install / Build Setup

Built with ES6, webpack, babel, [Vue][vue] 2.0. Project Structure derives from the vuejs es6 webpack template.
([repo][tmplrepo], [docs][tmpldocs])  Running locally requires npm and should be as easy as running the following:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
